		The Goblin Keep
The stone walls are still standing all around but the keep doors are lying rotten next to the entrance.
*** Telling of the initial view ***
	Courtyard
The courtyard is a round open are, surrounded by various buildings of which most are collapsed. Still standing are the Guardhouse, The Lord's home, an animal pen, the goblin dining room and one out of three watchtowers. In the courtyard is a small training area, a few tables and benches.

	Guard House
Used as the goblins sleeping quarters. It was built for maybe 6-8 guards, so it seems to be a little crowded now. Most of the goblins will be sleeping here if they enter during the night.
	Kitchen
A simple building with two cooking pits digged in the middle. Not much action here unless it's cooking time.
	Animal Pen
It's a small animal pen, probably built for hunting dogs originally. It has a small ante-room and then six large cages, surprisingly a few of them seem to be used recently.
	The Lord's House
It's a relatively large, two story building built mainly out of stone. 
	The Cellar
